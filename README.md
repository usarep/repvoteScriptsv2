# USArep Scripts (Perl and bash) 

This repostitory contains the scripts for pulling/synchronizing data from various third party sites.

We use [Perlbrew](https://perlbrew.pl) to manage our perl environment. With Perlbrew, you can install 
perl libraries in user-land. Otherwise, you will need to install them in system-land. You do not need Perlbrew, 
it's just a convenience.

You will need to install the various perl libraries used in the code from cpan. Please google "cpan install" without the quotes for more information.

The code also accesses a couple of local mysql databases. Documentation on the
db schema etc. are a TODO. Please ping us if you are planning to work on this.
