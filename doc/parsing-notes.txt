https://www.congress.gov/treaty-document/114th-congress/12

document number for Treat Docs could be of the form 114-12 
(congress==114, docNumber==12)
e.g., https://www.senate.gov/legislative/LIS/roll_call_votes/vote1151/vote_115_1_00097.xml

The issue is shown on the roll-call summary page as Treaty Doc. 114-12
https://www.senate.gov/legislative/LIS/roll_call_lists/vote_menu_115_1.htm

and the xml for the roll call has this fragment:

<document>
 <document_congress>115</document_congress>
 <document_type>Treaty Doc.</document_type>
 <document_number>114-12</document_number>
 <document_name>Treaty Doc. 114-12</document_name>
 <document_title>
  Protocol to the North Atlantic Treaty of 1949 on the Accession of Montenegro
  </document_title>
  <document_short_title/>
</document>

quick and dirty solution:
add roll_call_doc_number_str varchar(20) as a new column in the db.
add a corresponding field in solr.
and also in solr-queries.
in front end, if rollCallDocNumStr is there, use it. create a link directly
to the treaty doc on congress.gov, format:
https://www.congress.gov/treaty-document/114th-congress/12
